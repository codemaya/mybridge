 Packet Length: The length, in bytes, of the packet
 that follows the Packet Header. There
 may be some special values in the most
 significant byte. Since 2**24 = MB,
 the maximum packet length is 16MB.

 Packet Number: A serial number which can be used to
 ensure that all packets are present
 and in order. The first packet of a
 client query will have Packet Number = 0
 Thus, when a new SQL statement starts,  
 the packet number is re-initialised.
